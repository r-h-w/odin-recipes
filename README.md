# odin-recipes
1st Project of The Odin Project

In This Project I will create the basic html structure for a recipe website.
I will need to use my knowledge of: terminal navigation, git repositories, html boilerplate, structure, attributes, nesting, links, image insertion etc.
I will probably end up doing several 'git add' + 'git commit' cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with 'git push' (origin main - optional).
